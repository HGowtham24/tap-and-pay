Scope Definition
The Tap and Pay E-Ticketing system is a digital infrastructure designed to facilitate seamless, contactless fare collection. It enables commuters to pay for journeys using NFC-enabled devices (smartphones, smartwatches) or EMV contactless bank cards, replacing traditional paper tickets and manual cash handling.

Out-of-Scope Features
The following features are explicitly excluded from the current phase of development to ensure system stability and performance:

Physical Ticket Vending: The system will not support the issuance or printing of physical paper tickets or magnetic stripe cards.

Cash Management: Handling of physical currency at kiosks or by staff for top-ups is excluded; all transactions must be digital.

Complex Route Planning: While the system handles payments, a full-scale GPS navigation or multi-modal trip planning engine (like Google Maps integration) is out-of-scope.

Retail/Merchant Payments: The tap-and-pay functionality is strictly limited to transit fare collection and cannot be used for third-party retail purchases within the station.

Legacy Hardware Support: The system will not integrate with older, non-NFC turnstiles or manual validation gates.

On-board Fine Management: Real-time processing of penalties or fines for fare evasion by transit officers via the app is excluded.
