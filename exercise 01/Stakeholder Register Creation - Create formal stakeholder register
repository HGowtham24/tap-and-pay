Project: Tap and Pay System for Contactless Bus Fare Collection
The stakeholder register for the Tap and Pay system identifies all individuals and organizations involved in or affected by the implementation of the contactless bus fare payment solution. Passengers and commuters are the primary end users of the system, responsible for making fare payments using NFC-enabled devices. Their main interests include fast, secure, and convenient cashless transactions, and they have a moderate level of influence as user adoption determines system success.
Bus conductors play an operational role by verifying payments and assisting passengers during boarding. They are interested in simplified fare verification, reduced cash handling, and accurate transaction records, and they hold a moderate influence on daily system operations. Bus drivers, while not directly involved in payment processing, are concerned with smooth passenger flow and reduced delays at bus stops. Their influence on system decisions is relatively low.
Transport authorities and bus operators are key stakeholders with high influence, as they own, deploy, and manage the system. Their interests include efficient revenue collection, transparency in fare management, reduced leakage, and improved service quality. Government and regulatory bodies also hold high influence, ensuring compliance with transportation policies, digital payment regulations, and public safety standards.
Banks and payment service providers are responsible for processing transactions and settlements. Their interests focus on secure, reliable financial transactions and regulatory compliance, giving them a high level of influence over system integration and operation. System developers and IT support teams are responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining the Tap and Pay system. They are interested in clear requirements, system stability, scalability, and ease of maintenance, and they possess a moderate level of influence.
Additionally, hardware vendors supplying NFC fare readers are interested in device compatibility, performance, and maintenance contracts, though their influence is relatively low. Maintenance, operations, and security teams, including auditors, focus on system uptime, fault resolution, data protection, and fraud prevention. These stakeholders have a moderate influence in ensuring continuous, secure, and reliable system operation.
This stakeholder register provides a structured understanding of stakeholder roles, interests, and influence, enabling effective communication, risk management, and successful deployment of the Tap and Pay bus fare collection system.
