Project: Tap and Pay System for Contactless Bus Fare Collection
The Tap and Pay system for bus fare collection does not include features that extend beyond basic contactless fare payment and system management. The project does not cover cash handling or cash-based ticketing, and it does not replace existing manual ticketing systems during the initial implementation phase. Integration with non-bus transportation modes, such as metro trains, railways, taxis, or ride-sharing services, is outside the scope of this project.
Advanced features such as dynamic pricing based on demand, distance-based fare calculation using GPS tracking, or real-time route optimization are not included. The system does not support offline transaction processing beyond basic temporary storage, and full functionality requires an active network connection. Cross-border or international payment processing is also excluded.
The project does not include the development of custom hardware manufacturing, as only software integration with existing NFC-enabled fare readers is considered. Features such as loyalty programs, reward points, promotional offers, and third-party advertisements are not part of the current scope. Additionally, advanced analytics, AI-based passenger prediction, or fraud detection models are excluded from this implementation.
Customer support services such as call centers, dispute resolution portals, and refund management systems are also outside the scope. Any future enhancements related to system expansion, multi-city interoperability, or integration with other smart city services are not addressed in this project.
