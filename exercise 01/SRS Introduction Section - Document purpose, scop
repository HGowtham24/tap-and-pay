1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to describe the functional and non-functional requirements of the Tap and Pay System for Contactless Bus Fare Collection. This document serves as a reference for stakeholders including transport authorities, developers, testers, and project evaluators by clearly defining system behavior, constraints, and performance expectations. It provides a structured understanding of the system requirements to ensure correct design, development, implementation, and validation of the Tap and Pay solution.
1.2 Scope Definition
The Tap and Pay System is a contactless digital payment solution designed to simplify and secure fare collection in public bus transportation. The system enables passengers to pay bus fares by tapping an NFC-enabled smartphone, smart card, or wearable device on a fare reader installed inside the bus. It supports secure transaction processing, automatic fare deduction, and instant confirmation of payment.
The scope of the system includes user registration, wallet or bank account integration, transaction logging, payment verification for bus conductors, and backend communication with payment gateways and transport authority servers. The system also provides basic reporting and monitoring features for operators, ensuring transparency and efficient revenue management.
The system scope excludes cash-based ticketing, manual fare collection, integration with other modes of transport, advanced fare analytics, and customer service operations such as refunds and dispute management. The Tap and Pay System is limited to bus transportation and focuses on delivering a fast, secure, and user-friendly contactless fare payment experience.
