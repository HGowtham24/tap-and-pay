The Tap and Pay System for Contactless Bus Fare Collection involves several stakeholders, each with specific roles, interests, and levels of influence. Passengers and commuters are the primary end users who pay bus fares using NFC-enabled devices or smart cards. Their main interest lies in fast, secure, and cashless fare payments, and they have a moderate level of influence since user adoption directly affects system success. Bus conductors verify passenger payments and assist during boarding. They are interested in easy payment verification, reduced cash handling, and accurate transaction records, holding a moderate influence over day-to-day system operations. Bus drivers ensure smooth passenger flow and reduced boarding delays, though their influence on system decisions is relatively low.
Transport authorities and bus operators own and manage the bus services, making them high-influence stakeholders. Their interests include transparent revenue collection, operational efficiency, and system monitoring. Government and regulatory bodies also hold high influence, as they ensure compliance with transportation policies, digital payment regulations, and public safety requirements. Banks and payment service providers process digital transactions securely and are concerned with financial compliance and reliable system integration, giving them high influence over system performance.
System developers and IT teams are responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining the Tap and Pay system. Their focus is on clear requirements, system stability, and maintainability, and they have a moderate level of influence. Hardware vendors supplying NFC fare readers are concerned with device reliability and maintenance contracts, but their influence is relatively low. Maintenance and operations teams, along with auditors and security personnel, are interested in system uptime, fault resolution, data protection, and fraud prevention, holding moderate influence in ensuring continuous and secure system operation.
This stakeholder register provides a comprehensive view of all participants, helping the project team manage communication, expectations, and risks effectively while ensuring successful deployment of the Tap and Pay system in buses.
