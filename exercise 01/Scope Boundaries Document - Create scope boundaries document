The scope boundaries of the Tap and Pay system clearly define what the project will and will not address to ensure focused development and controlled expectations. The project scope begins with the passenger boarding process, where a user initiates payment by tapping an NFC-enabled smartphone, smart card, or wearable device on a fare reader installed inside the bus. The system boundary includes fare validation, secure transaction processing, and instant confirmation of payment to both the passenger and bus staff.
Within the system boundary, the project covers user registration, wallet or bank account linkage, fare deduction, transaction logging, and backend communication with payment gateways and transport authority servers. The system also includes payment verification for conductors, basic monitoring of device status, and generation of operational and revenue reports for transport authorities. Security mechanisms such as encryption, tokenization, and authentication are considered part of the internal system scope.
The scope boundary excludes cash-based transactions, manual ticket issuance, and physical card manufacturing. It also excludes integration with other modes of transport, advanced fare optimization, loyalty programs, and third-party services. Features requiring complex analytics, AI-based predictions, or international payment support are outside the system boundary. Additionally, customer service operations, refund management, and dispute resolution processes are not handled within this project scope.
In summary, the scope boundaries define the Tap and Pay system as a contactless digital fare payment solution limited to bus transportation, focusing on secure transactions, efficient boarding, and operational transparency, while clearly excluding unrelated or advanced functionalities beyond the core objectives.
