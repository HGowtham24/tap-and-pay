2.1 Product Perspective
The Tap and Pay System for Contactless Bus Fare Collection is a standalone digital payment system that integrates with existing public bus transportation infrastructure. It operates alongside current bus operations by introducing NFC-enabled fare readers inside buses and a centralized backend system connected to banking and payment gateways. The system interacts with user devices, payment service providers, and transport authority databases to ensure secure and real-time fare processing. It does not replace the bus transport system itself but enhances the fare collection process by digitizing payments and reducing dependency on cash-based transactions.
2.2 Product Functions
The primary function of the Tap and Pay System is to enable passengers to pay bus fares through contactless payment methods. The system authenticates users, deducts the appropriate fare from a linked wallet or bank account, and provides instant confirmation of successful or failed transactions. It maintains transaction records, supports payment verification for conductors, and communicates with backend servers for settlement and reporting. Additional functions include user account management, fare rule configuration, device status monitoring, and generation of operational and revenue reports for transport authorities.
2.3 User Characteristics
The system is intended for a diverse group of users with varying levels of technical proficiency. Passengers may include daily commuters, students, senior citizens, and occasional travelers, most of whom are expected to have basic familiarity with smartphones or contactless cards. Bus conductors and drivers are operational users who require minimal training and simple interfaces for payment verification. Transport authority staff and administrators are expected to have moderate technical knowledge to manage reports, system configurations, and monitoring tools. System developers and maintenance personnel require advanced technical skills for system support and updates.
2.4 Constraints
The Tap and Pay System operates under several constraints, including dependency on NFC-enabled devices and availability of network connectivity for real-time transaction processing. The system must comply with government regulations related to digital payments, data privacy, and public transportation. Hardware compatibility with existing bus infrastructure and payment terminals is a key constraint. Security requirements such as encryption and secure authentication must be strictly followed. Budget limitations, deployment timelines, and system scalability requirements also constrain the design and implementation of the system.
