The successful implementation of the Tap and Pay system for bus fare collection involves multiple stakeholders with varying interests and levels of influence. Passengers and daily commuters are primarily interested in fast, convenient, and secure fare payments that reduce boarding time and eliminate the need for cash. Their influence on the system is moderate, as widespread user adoption directly affects the success of the solution.
Bus conductors have an interest in simplified fare verification, reduced cash handling, and accurate transaction records, which help minimize errors and disputes. Their influence is moderate because they interact with the system on a daily basis. Bus drivers, while not directly handling payments, are interested in smooth passenger flow and reduced delays at bus stops. Their influence on system decisions is relatively low.
Transport authorities and bus operators are high-influence stakeholders, as they are responsible for system approval, deployment, and overall management. Their primary interests include efficient revenue collection, reduced fare leakage, operational transparency, and improved service quality. Government and regulatory bodies also hold high influence, as they ensure compliance with transportation policies, digital payment regulations, and public safety standards.
Banks and payment service providers are interested in secure, reliable transaction processing and regulatory compliance. Their influence is high due to their role in handling financial transactions and settlements. System developers and IT support teams focus on system stability, clear requirements, ease of maintenance, and scalability, holding a moderate level of influence over technical implementation.
Additionally, hardware vendors supplying NFC readers and payment devices are interested in device compatibility, performance, and maintenance contracts, though their influence is relatively low. Maintenance, operations, and security teams are concerned with system uptime, fault resolution, fraud prevention, and data protection, and they hold a moderate influence in ensuring continuous and secure operation of the system.
Overall, understanding stakeholder interests and influence helps in designing a secure, efficient, and user-friendly Tap and Pay bus fare system while ensuring regulatory compliance and smooth operational management.
