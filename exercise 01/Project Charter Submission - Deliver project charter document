Appendix B: Brief Use Case Explanation (Optional but Recommended)
The Passenger interacts with the system to register, link a payment method, and pay the bus fare using a tap-based NFC mechanism. Upon successful payment, the passenger receives instant confirmation and can later view transaction history. The Bus Conductor verifies payment status in real time to ensure valid fare collection. The Transport Authority monitors system performance and generates revenue and usage reports. The Payment Gateway processes and authorizes all financial transactions securely.

Here’s the project glossary rewritten fully in paragraph form for your Tap and Pay System for Bus Fare Collection, suitable for reports or appendices.
Project Glossary
The Tap and Pay System project involves several key terms and concepts related to contactless bus fare collection. NFC (Near Field Communication) is the short-range wireless technology that enables devices to exchange information when in close proximity, allowing passengers to complete payments by simply tapping their device. Tap and Pay refers to the digital payment method where a passenger pays the bus fare using an NFC-enabled smartphone, smart card, or wearable device. The fare reader is the device installed in buses that detects these taps and processes payments securely. Passengers are the users of the bus system who make fare payments through the Tap and Pay system, while bus conductors are staff members responsible for verifying payments and assisting passengers during boarding. The transport authority manages bus operations, oversees revenue collection, and monitors system performance, while the payment gateway is a third-party service that processes digital transactions securely between passengers and banks.
A digital wallet is an electronic account that stores payment information and enables passengers to make fast, cashless payments. To ensure security, techniques such as tokenization and encryption are employed to protect sensitive payment data during transactions. Authentication refers to the verification process used to confirm the identity of the user or the validity of a transaction, which can include PINs, passwords, or biometrics. All fare transactions are stored in a transaction history, which records the date, time, and amount for future reference. The backend server is the central system that processes transactions, communicates with payment gateways, and manages data for the transport authority. Other important concepts include uptime, which measures system availability, error handling, which ensures proper management of failed transactions or device issues, and contactless payment, which refers to completing transactions without physical contact, improving speed, convenience, and hygiene for passengers.
