Problem Statement
Public bus transportation systems largely rely on cash payments or physical tickets, which often lead to long queues, delays during boarding, cash handling issues, and revenue leakage. Conductors and passengers face problems such as lack of exact change, slow ticketing processes, and physical contact during transactions. These issues increase travel time, reduce operational efficiency, and create inconvenience for daily commuters, especially during peak hours.
There is a need for a fast, secure, and contactless fare payment system that simplifies bus boarding and improves the overall commuter experience.
Proposed Solution
The Tap and Pay System for Buses enables passengers to pay their bus fare by tapping an NFC-enabled smartphone, smart card, or wearable device on a fare reader installed inside the bus. The system automatically deducts the fare from the user’s digital wallet or linked bank account and provides instant transaction confirmation. Secure technologies such as encryption, tokenization, and optional biometric authentication ensure safe and reliable payments.
Target Users
Daily commuters and passengers
Bus transport corporations (government and private)
Bus conductors and drivers
Students and office commuters
Tourists and occasional travelers
