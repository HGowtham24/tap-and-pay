Project: Tap and Pay System for Contactless Bus Fare Collection
The Tap and Pay system for bus fare collection includes features that support secure, fast, and contactless payment during passenger boarding. The system allows passengers to pay their bus fare by tapping an NFC-enabled smartphone, smart card, or wearable device on a fare reader installed inside the bus. Fare deduction is performed automatically based on predefined fare rules, and passengers receive instant confirmation of successful transactions through visual or audio indicators.
The system includes user registration and wallet management, enabling passengers to link their bank account or digital wallet, view transaction history, and recharge their balance. Secure authentication mechanisms, such as encrypted transactions, tokenization, and optional biometric verification, are included to protect user data and prevent fraud. The system also supports real-time transaction processing with immediate updates to backend servers.
For bus staff, the system provides payment verification functionality that allows conductors to check transaction status quickly using a display or handheld device. Backend management features are included for transport authorities to monitor fare collection, generate reports, and analyze ridership data. The scope also covers integration with banking systems and payment gateways to ensure smooth settlement of transactions.
Additionally, the project includes basic system maintenance and monitoring, such as error detection, device status monitoring, and transaction logging. User notifications for successful or failed payments and system alerts for operational issues are also part of the in-scope features.
