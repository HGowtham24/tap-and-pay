Workflow 1: Passenger Boarding and Payment Process
Actors: Passenger, Bus Conductor, System, Payment Gateway
Steps and Decision Points:
Passenger Authentication
Passenger opens Tap and Pay app
Decision: Does the passenger have an account?
No: Passenger registers → account created → login
Yes: Proceed to login
Wallet / Bank Linking
Passenger links digital wallet or bank account
System verifies account through Payment Gateway
Boarding the Bus
Passenger approaches the bus
Decision: Is NFC reader functional?
Yes: Proceed with Tap-to-Pay
No: Passenger directed to alternative payment
Tap-to-Pay Process
Passenger taps device → System detects tap
Payment authentication occurs → forwarded to Payment Gateway
Decision: Is payment successful?
Yes: Payment confirmation sent to Passenger and Conductor → Boarding allowed
No: Error Handling triggered → Passenger prompted to retry/add funds
Parallel Activities
System logs transaction
Conductor simultaneously verifies payment and updates boarding status
Workflow 2: Admin and Reporting Process
Actors: Admin, System, Auditor (Optional)
Steps and Decision Points:
System Monitoring
Admin monitors system performance, device status, and transaction logs
Decision: Are there any system errors or unusual activity?
Yes: Alerts sent → IT team notified
No: Continue monitoring
Report Generation
Admin generates reports (daily/weekly/monthly)
Reports include revenue, passenger statistics, transaction success/failure rates
Optional Audit
Decision: Is audit required?
Yes: Auditor reviews logs for security and compliance
No: Workflow continues
System Maintenance (Parallel Activity)
Admin schedules updates and patches
Maintenance runs in parallel with monitoring to avoid service disruption
Workflow 3: Error Handling and Alerts
Actors: System, Passenger, Conductor, Admin
Steps:
Detect failed transaction, insufficient balance, or NFC device error
Generate alert to Passenger (retry/add funds)
Notify Conductor of issue
Log error in system for Admin review
Optional: Admin triggers maintenance or resolves device issue
