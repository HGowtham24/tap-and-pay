Steps to Set Up the Workspace
Choose the CASE Tool
Examples: Enterprise Architect, Visual Paradigm, Rational Rose, StarUML
Ensure all team members have access to the tool.
Create a Project Repository
Set up a shared project file or repository in the CASE tool.
Could be:
Local network shared folder
Cloud-based storage (Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.)
Built-in version control in the CASE tool
Define Folder Structure
Typical structure:
/Project_Name
   /Requirements
   /Design
      /Diagrams
   /Implementation
   /Testing
   /Documentation
Keeps files organized and easy to navigate.
Set User Roles & Permissions
Assign roles like Admin, Designer, Reviewer, Tester.
Restrict write access if necessary.
Integrate Version Control (Optional but Recommended)
Tools: Git, SVN
Ensures team collaboration without overwriting each other’s work.
Create Templates
Standardize diagrams and documents:
Use consistent UML templates: Use Case, Sequence, Class, Activity diagrams.
Document templates: Requirement specs, Test plans.
Test Collaboration Setup
Have all members:
Open the workspace
Create/edit a diagram
Commit changes (if version-controlled)
Ensure changes are reflected for everyone.
Document Workspace Guidelines
Create a short guide for team members:
How to check in/out files
Naming conventions
Directory usage
